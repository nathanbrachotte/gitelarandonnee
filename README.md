# GÃ®te La RandonnÃ©e Website

A rental property website built with Astro, featuring dual rental system support.

## Dual Rental System Implementation

This project has been enhanced to support two rental properties:

- **La RandonnÃ©e** (original, purple theme) - `/`
- **LÃ -Haut** (new, green theme) - `/la-haut/`

### Implementation Details

#### 1. URL Structure

- Main rental "La RandonnÃ©e": Standard URLs (e.g., `/`, `/disponibilites`)
- New rental "LÃ -Haut": Prefixed URLs (e.g., `/la-haut/`, `/la-haut/disponibilites`)
- Shared pages (like `/decouvrir-la-region`) remain the same for both rentals

#### 5. Implementation Status

**âœ… Completed:**

- [ ] URL routing system with rental prefixes
- [ ] Header dropdown for rental selection
- [ ] Rental-specific content and images
- [ ] Green theme implementation for "LÃ -Haut"
- [ ] Dynamic home page content based on rental
- [ ] Placeholder content for new rental
- [ ] Type-safe rental system

**ðŸ”„ Testing Required:**

1. Test dropdown functionality on both rentals
2. Verify URL routing works correctly
3. Test page structure handles both rentals
4. Validate theme switching
5. Test mobile responsiveness of new dropdown

**ðŸ“‹ Future Enhancements:**

- Add rental-specific SEO meta tags
- Implement rental-specific pricing
- Add rental-specific gallery images
- Extend to other pages (pricing, availability, etc.)
- Add proper error handling for invalid rental URLs

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
